# Genshin Impact OC Making Resources

If you want to make a Genshin OC in 3d, and you need model sources for hair, body, clothing, etc.







Models are from Genshin Impact, Honkai Impact 3rd, Honkai Star Rail, Wuthering Waves(More detailed but relatively similar), Tower Of Fantasy(You can mix fronts and backs for the main character hair choices, and use parts of the character clothing). If you have any games that would work and want them put here, lmk in the issues page.
